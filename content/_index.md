    You've no-clipped through reality into a space between spaces—a place
    stitched together from outdated furniture, buzzing fluorescent lights, and
    the quiet hum of something watching. There is no map. There is no logic.
    Just keep moving. And whatever you do, don’t trust the wallpaper.

          maybe you still are.

          It rearranges when you're not looking. Supplies appear, but they’re
          never what you need. Something else is shopping, too.

          The humming is louder now. It matches your heartbeat. That’s not a
          coincidence.
