          This argument doesn't deny the subjective *feeling* of freedom. We
          deliberate, weigh options, and feel like we are making choices. Hard
          determinists argue this feeling is compatible with determinism; it
          reflects our conscious awareness of acting according to our determined
          desires and beliefs, without overt external coercion, but it doesn't
          equate to genuine metaphysical freedom (the ability to have chosen
          differently under the *exact* same circumstances).

        alt_text:

          This argument specifically targets the *libertarian* concept of free
          will. Compatibilists (or Soft Determinists) disagree, arguing that
          free will *is* compatible with determinism. They do this by redefining
          free will, often removing the requirement for alternative
          possibilities or ultimate sourcehood in the strong sense. For a
          compatibilist, freedom might mean acting voluntarily according to
          one's desires and values, without coercion, even if those desires and
          values are themselves determined. This argument presented above
          rejects that compatibilist redefinition as insufficient for the kind
          of free will often thought necessary for deep moral responsibility.

        alt_text:
        copy: >-
          A significant consequence often drawn from this argument is that if
          determinism is true and libertarian free will is impossible, then
          traditional notions of moral responsibility (based on praise and blame
          for actions one could not have avoided doing) are undermined. This
          leads to further debates about whether responsibility can be redefined
          (perhaps compatibilistically) or if our practices of punishment and
          reward need radical revision.
