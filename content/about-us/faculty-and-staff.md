      ## WVU Students and Staff


      In addition to our teachers, WVU students from various disciplines play a
      valuable role in our school. They complete placements within the school,
      assisting with supervision, activities, and project-based learning. Work
      Study students also serve as assistant teachers, providing support in the
      classroom and gaining valuable experience in early childhood education.

      ## Commitment to Professional Development


      We believe in the importance of ongoing professional development to ensure
      that our staff is up-to-date with the latest research and best practices
      in early childhood education. Our teachers participate in various training
      opportunities, including:


      * Higher education courses

      * WV STARS-approved training

      * Monongalia County Schools programs


      All new staff members complete comprehensive orientations, including a
      review of our handbook and school policies, to ensure they are
      well-prepared to support our children and families.
