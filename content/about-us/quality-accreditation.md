      ## Quality Standards


      The WVU Nursery School is evaluated using the Early Childhood
      Environmental Rating Scale (ECERS)—3rd edition. This assessment tool helps
      us maintain a high standard of early childhood education by evaluating
      various aspects of our program, including:


      * Classroom environment and interactions

      * Curriculum and activities

      * Health and safety practices

      * Interactions between children and staff


      Our center is classified as a Type 1 childcare center. This classification
      indicates that we meet the rigorous requirements for quality early
      learning environments in West Virginia.
