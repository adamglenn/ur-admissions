      The West Virginia University Division for Land-Grant Engagement supports
      the teaching, research and service missions of the Davis College of
      Agriculture and Natural Resources, WVU Extension and WVU Center for
      Community Engagement. The Division brings together units which have
      historically defined WVU’s land-grant partnership with the federal
      government, including USDA-NIFA and other agencies.

      This Division celebrates WVU’s history as marked by four federal acts: The
      Morrill, Hatch, Smith-Lever, McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry
      Research acts.


      Our faculty and staff are dedicated to carrying out the land-grant mission
      to provide knowledge and research to improve the lives and livelihoods of
      our students, alumni, community partners, and the state of West Virginia.
