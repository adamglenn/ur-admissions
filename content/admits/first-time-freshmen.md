          ## Pay the Academic Deposit

          The academic deposit saves your place in our incoming class and is required to move forward with housing, math placement and New Student Orientation.

          Your academic deposit is fully refundable if you cancel your WVU attendance before May 1 for fall term enrollment and December 1 for spring term enrollment.
