      PIM is recognized as a leading center for pure mathematics, a field that
      supports all applied mathematical advancements. Celikbas’ work is focused
      on commutative and homological algebra, key areas that contribute to
      fields such as algebraic geometry, number theory and coding theory.

      “I went after this opportunity because the Max Planck Institute for
      Mathematics is dedicated to fundamental research, which is essential for
      making lasting contributions to technology and problem-solving,” he said.
      “While applied mathematics helps solve specific challenges, pure
      mathematics lays the groundwork for these solutions. Being invited to MPIM
      is a great acknowledgment of my work, and it has motivated me to push my
      research even further.”


      Celikbas’s visit to MPIM will help contribute to new research
      collaborations and publications in the field of commutative and
      homological algebra, helping to bolster WVU’s engagement with the global
      mathematics research community. During his time there, he will engage with
      the global mathematical community as he delivers research talks,
      collaborates with other mathematicians and organizes an algebra seminar
      for Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows.


      “The institute offers extensive research resources, including a
      world-class mathematics library, broad access to research journals, and
      MathSciNet, a vital platform for mathematical research,” he said. “This
      visit aligns with my long-term goal of becoming a stronger researcher in
      my field.”


      Celikbas will also have the opportunity to immerse himself in the culture
      of Bonn, a vibrant city known for its cultural diversity and fantastic
      food, and in the academic culture of the University of Bonn. The
      University of Bonn is home to an outstanding mathematics faculty,
      including a Fields Medal winner, which is the highest honor in
      mathematics.


      He is accompanied by Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Eberly College,
      Dr. Ela Celikbas. Together, they specialize in homological and commutative
      algebra, which have implications for fields ranging from representation
      theory to mathematical physics and even applications in cryptography and
      robotics.
