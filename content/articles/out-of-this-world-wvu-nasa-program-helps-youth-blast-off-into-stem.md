      The students are getting lessons on gravitational waves and wave
      frequencies, courtesy of Science Behind the Sport at West Virginia
      University. It’s just one of many STEM-related activities for students
      from all across the Mountain State on NASA Day, sponsored by the

      NASA West Virginia Space Grant Consortium at WVU. The Consortium focuses
      on building research infrastructure and the promotion of STEM education in
      West Virginia. In 2024, NASA Day celebrated its 10th anniversary of
      providing community outreach through demonstrations and activities
      centered around the world of science and space exploration.
