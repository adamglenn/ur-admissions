      WVU may grant Academic Forgiveness to some undergraduate students who were
      not successful in their first attempt at higher education.


      ## **Policy**


      * For the purposes of admission, the West Virginia University system may
      honor academic forgiveness granted at a previously attended regionally
      accredited institution. Students requesting admittance who wish to have a
      previous grant of academic forgiveness honored must have a GPA of 2.0 or
      higher in at least 24 earned credit hours after academic forgiveness was
      applied.

      * A student may receive academic forgiveness only once.

      * Students requesting academic forgiveness cannot have been enrolled at
      any higher education institution for at least the last four calendar
      years.

      * Students who receive academic forgiveness from the West Virginia
      University system will receive credit for all courses completed with a
      grade of D- or higher during the forgiven period of enrollment. While all
      grades and credit hours remain on the student’s transcript, grades earned
      during the forgiven enrollment period will not be counted in the student’s
      GPA.

      * After receiving forgiveness, the student must satisfactorily complete
      all coursework required by the academic unit for graduation and at least
      15 credit hours in the WVU system for an associate degree or 30 credit
      hours for a bachelor’s degree.

      * Students who receive academic forgiveness are not eligible to graduate
      with Latin honors.

      * Academic forgiveness does not supersede some calculations used to
      determine eligibility fo [Satisfactory Academic
      Progress](https://financialaid.wvu.edu/home/maintain/academic-progress)
      regarding financial aid, scholarships, and the veterans’ benefits.

      * Some professional programs and other regionally accredited institutions
      may not honor academic forgiveness conferred by the West Virginia
      University system. Students receiving academic forgiveness should consult
      with an academic advisor in the field they wish to pursue.


      ## **Procedure**


      * Students must complete the [Petition for Admission under Academic
      Forgiveness Policy
      form](https://admissions.wvu.edu/files/d/ab37ece0-f2d5-4258-9578-3ec9002517b1/petition-for-academic-forgiveness.pdf)
      and provide any requested documentation.

      * Students applying for financial aid will need to submit a Free
      Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at the [Federal Student
      Aid](https://studentaid.gov/) webpage and file a Satisfactory Academic
      Process Appeal (SAP) if necessary.

      * The form must be approved by the dean of the intended academic major and
      the Provost or designee. The Provost or designee makes the final decision
      regarding admission to WVU under the Academic Forgiveness policy.

      * Students applying for Academic Forgiveness must meet with an academic
      advisor within the academic department they plan to enter.
