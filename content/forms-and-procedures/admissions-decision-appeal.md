      ## **Eligibility**


      ### **First-time freshmen and transfer students**


      Please review the following information to determine if you qualify to
      appeal your admissions decision at WVU.


      * If you are a first-time freshman and have **new official SAT or ACT
      scores and/or a new official high school transcript with an updated GPA
      calculation**, you may continue to work with your [admissions
      representative](https://admissions.wvu.edu/forms-and-procedures/admissions-decision-appeal#anchor-findadmissionsrep)
      to have new credentials reviewed for consideration for the main campus.
      You are not required to formally appeal.

      * If you are a first-time freshman **admitted to the Undergraduate Studies
      program but denied admission to a particular academic major**, you do not
      need to file an admissions appeal. If you have an improved GPA and/or test
      score, then you will need to work with your [admissions
      representative](https://admissions.wvu.edu/forms-and-procedures/admissions-decision-appeal#anchor-findadmissionsrep)
      to make sure your file has been updated to the appropriate major.

      * If you are a first-time freshman **referred to Potomac State College or
      WVU Institute of Technology and have updated credentials**, you may work
      with your WVU [admissions
      representative](https://admissions.wvu.edu/forms-and-procedures/admissions-decision-appeal#anchor-findadmissionsrep)
      to review the requirements for the main campus.

      * If you are a new transfer student and have sent an **updated college
      transcript,** you will not be required to formally appeal. You may work
      with a [transfer admissions
      representative](https://admissions.wvu.edu/forms-and-procedures/admissions-decision-appeal#anchor-findadmissionsrep)
      to have new credentials reviewed for consideration for admission.

      * Transfer students **applying to a health sciences program** are not
      eligible to file the appeal process. You should contact your [admissions
      representative](https://admissions.wvu.edu/forms-and-procedures/admissions-decision-appeal#anchor-findadmissionsrep)
      to determine next steps


      If you are a first-time freshman or first-time transfer student who has
      received a letter from the WVU Office of Admissions denying admission to
      the Morgantown campus and do not meet any of the scenarios outlined above,
      then you are eligible to file an appeal.


      ### **Nontraditional Students**


      Non-traditional student appeals are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If
      you are classified as a non-traditional student and wish to appeal your
      decision, please reach out to your
      [representative](https://admissions.wvu.edu/forms-and-procedures/admissions-decision-appeal#anchor-findadmissionsrep)
      to discuss next steps.


      ## **Procedure**


      If you determine from the information outlined above that you qualify to
      appeal your admissions decision, your first step is to reach out to your
      admissions representative. They will assist you by providing a timeline
      and instructions for submitting the documentation necessary to evaluate
      your decision and begin the appeal process.
