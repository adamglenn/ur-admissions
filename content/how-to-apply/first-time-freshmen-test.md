      senior, have a high school equivalency diploma or haven't attended college
      since graduating from high school.

          Review the admission requirements for on-campus majors, including 9-12
          grade coursework.


          You will be prompted to indicate if you are applying test optional
          when you complete the application. Learn more about our test-optional
          policy. Test-optional applicants are eligible to submit scores at a
          later date. We encourage you to send all score dates due to
          superscoring.

          To apply for an on-campus program, complete the WVU Application or the
          Common Application. The fee is $50 for domestic students and $65 for
          international applicants.


          Students applying to a WVU Online program should visit the WVU Online
          Campus application instructions.

          WVU Admissions will begin reviewing applications in September. At that
          time, applicants will receive an admissions decision or notification
          of outstanding materials.

          To ensure that your application is complete, please consider the
          following:

          - Self-reported items are NOT accepted via the Common App, including
          courses, grades, test scores and GPA.

          - Applicants are required to submit an official transcript to the WVU
          Office of Admissions and cannot upload an unofficial transcript via
          the Common App or WVU Application.

          - Essays and recommendations are not required.

          - Test scores are optional to receive an admissions decision; a few
          majors and scholarships require test scores.
