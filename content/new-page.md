      Established in 1944 under the Division of Home Economics, the WVU Nursery
      School (formerly the WVU Child Development Laboratory School) was founded
      by Karina Thure Wood. The school was created to provide observation and
      practicum experiences for future parents, preschool teachers, and
      nutrition students.
