  quote: WVU Law recognizes the value of diversity in the legal profession, which is important to me. Also, WVU Law houses the West Virginia Innocence Project and I wanted to attend a law school with that option.

  quote: My most valuable experience [at WVU] would be the relationships I’ve been able to make within the Davis College. I certainly don’t know everyone, but at the same time, I feel as if there aren’t any strangers here. It was the kindred spirit of Davis that convinced me to go on a study abroad trip to Belize with 13 other Davis students, not knowing a single one of them. I came out of it with the most incredible memories and friendships.
