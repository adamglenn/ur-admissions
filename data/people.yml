  quote: My most valuable experience [at WVU] would be the relationships I’ve been able to make within the Davis College. I certainly don’t know everyone, but at the same time, I feel as if there aren’t any strangers here. It was the kindred spirit of Davis that convinced me to go on a study abroad trip to Belize with 13 other Davis students, not knowing a single one of them. I came out of it with the most incredible memories and friendships.

  quote: I started doing research pretty early, and I really just had the best professors and the best classes in the Immunology and Medical Microbiology Program. They opened my eyes to how deep you can get into one singular field, which was immunology for me. They really inspired me and made me realize that research is super interesting.
